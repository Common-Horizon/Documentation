Common Torizon General Documentation repository.

Torizon is a software platform that simplifies the process of developing and maintaining embedded software. It allows you to configure the system for IoT/IIoT with over the air updates (OTA) quickly and easily, so you can focus on application development instead of Linux builds. With Common Torizon, we experiment with extending the Torizon ecosystem beyond Toradex hardware.
